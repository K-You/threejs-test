Repo de test pour Three Js (Js 3D rendering lib)

Scripts: 

- `yarn dev` : nodemon
- `yarn start` : node

As a 3d lib, the hard js runs in browser, note node (hence the `client.js` in public directory)
As of ECMASCRIPT2016, Chrome will not allow files to import other files without running on a server (hence the node server)
